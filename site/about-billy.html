      <h2>Community Advocate</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Billy. For over 20 years I have been dedicated to helping
        people with disabilities succeed. My career began as a job coach
        assisting individuals in finding their first opportunities in the
        workplace.

      <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Since those early days, I've worked as a case manager supporting
        people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and
        autism spectrum disorder (ASD). I then served as a vocational
        counselor, guiding clients toward meaningful employment. Along the
        way, I also explored web design to make online resources more
        accessible and user friendly.

      <h2>Today</h2>
      <p>
        I now focus on artificial intelligence solutions that improve
        accessibility and vocational services. This site shares what I've
        learned so far and offers tools for professionals, clients and
        community members.
